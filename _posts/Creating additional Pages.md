Created a new URL page called Blogs by creating a new .md file named blogs.md
blog.md had the following text which I copied from another page

layout: blogpage
title: Read my Blogs
permalink: /blogs/

This pointed to an html file I created udner the layout folder called blogpage.html
	the "permalink" I think "connects" the url blogs.md page with the blogspage.html
