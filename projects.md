This page will display my portfolio. Once I get the fundamentals of my site down,each project's name, tags, date uploaded, and thumbnail will be displayed below. So far I like the current format. Each project will be an individual block with it's own clickable links. "View" will take you to the actual project. Each project will contain tags which will describe the main technolgies used for said project. The overarching "tags" which are currently displayed underneath this body of text will essentially reference the primary techologies, languages, and process used in the creation of my projects. For example, by clicking "python" it will take to a page that will display any and all projects of which Python was utilized.
